## Ben's Make Change Homework Project

This is my week 1 graded Homework.

The make change program is designed to help a cashier return customers proper change by telling them precisely what quantity of each denomination of bills and coins should be returned to the customer. The clerk must input the price of an/the item(s) as well as the cash tendered from the customer.

If the inputed cost of the item is greater than the amount given by the customer we assume there was a data entry error and ask the clerk to reenter both the price and the money tendered;  We believe it would be rather improbable that the clerk would require the program to notice the cost was higher than the cash given.
